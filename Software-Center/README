Ubuntu Software-Center DeLorean-Dark-Theme install.

First we should make a backup of the original folder.  We will name it css-Original.  In the event you choose to use another theme simply rename 'softwarecenter.css.Original' back to 'softwarecenter.css' and rename 'stipple.png.Original' to 'stipple.png'. To do this...
In terminal with root(administrator) privileges type the following:

sudo cp /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css.Original
sudo cp /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/stipple.png /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/stipple.png.Original

Now that we have made our backups.  We need to copy the DeLorean-Dark theme files.  
In terminal with root(administrator) privileges type the following if you have the delorean-dark theme installed system-wide in '/usr/share/themes/':

sudo cp /usr/share/themes/delorean-dark/Software-Center/softwarecenter.css /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css
sudo cp /usr/share/themes/delorean-dark/Software-Center/stipple.png /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/stipple.png

If you have the theme file in another location just 'cd' into the delorean-dark/Software-Center folder and type in terminal:

sudo cp softwarecenter.css /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css
sudo cp stipple.png /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/stipple.png

Now start/restart Ubuntu Software-Center.

*** the actual name of the delorean-dark theme folder may vary depending on what version you are using.  Ie. delorean-dark delorean-dark-theme delorean-dark[development] etc.  Make the necessary adjustment to the above code.
